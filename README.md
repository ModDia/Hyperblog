# Hyperblog ðŸ¥‡
> This site is an exercise for Git and Github course, this is my second course in Platzi and I am so satisfied. Actually control versioning tools are a necessary world that all have to know.
At the same time  I am studying English and practicing here my writing in my README file.

So  I will show you what commands I learned:
`$ git clone`
`$ git status`
`$ git remote`
`$ git log`
`$ git add`
`$ git commit`
`$ git pull`
`$ git push`

# Experience
Along the way I do not just learn of this, I installed WSL2 in Windows for use Ubuntu in my laptop, many urls of interesting web sites to support our learning and enjoy the community, any question we have is answered and we can contribute too.
